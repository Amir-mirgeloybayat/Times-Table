This is an Android student project working with common UI elements such as:
-buttons -textfields and also -listView which requires a list adapter.

It is a times table app that could help children with performing and memorizing multiplication.
User opens the app and enters a value as the maximum value. This value will be used by the app
to show the user the results of a "Value x Value" table besides launching a new activity.
Results will be shown in a list view and the user can scroll through different values from 1 to the 
maximum value to see their multiplications.
User will not be able to enter negative and NAN values, such as strings and characters.
There's also a back button that sends the user to the main activity.
